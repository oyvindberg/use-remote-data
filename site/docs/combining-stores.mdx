# Combining Stores

One of the library’s most powerful patterns is combining multiple requests.
If you have two or more `RemoteDataStore`s,
you can merge them into a single store that represents all requests in flight.
This is done via `RemoteDataStore.all(...)`:

Under the hood, the combined store uses the `RemoteData.all(...)` function, which:

- Returns `No` if _any_ store fails. A single “retry” will only re-fetch the failing requests.
- Returns `Pending` if _any_ constituent store is `Pending`.
- Returns `Yes` with a tuple of all combined values if _all_ succeed.
- Manages invalidation states if any store becomes invalidated.

In a render prop, you can
[destructure](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/crazy-powerful-typescript-tuple-types-9b121e0a690c)
the results.

#### A Note on TypeScript Tooling

The TypeScript compiler (and IDEs) fully understands these combined stores.
You can hover over the tuple items (often with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>) to see precise type information.
