# Failures and Retries

Handling and retrying transient failures can be tricky to implement.

`use-remote-data` offers robust error handling and retry logic out of the box, making it easy to do things right.

This example creates a `Promise` which fails every tenth time it is called.
The sometimes-failing store is combined with another store which never fails,
and you should hit _retry_ a few times to see the interaction.
