# Getting Started

## About
`use-remote-data` is a React hook that takes a principled, **type-safe** approach to fetching and managing async data.

At its core is the `RemoteData` union type,
which covers every possible state of a request (from “not yet fetched” to “success with stale data” or “failure”).

On top of this, a `RemoteDataStore` automatically handles orchestration — fetching, caching, error handling, invalidation,
and retries—so you can write clear, reliable async code with minimal boilerplate.

It also offers **optional** typed errors to distinguish between domain-level failures and unexpected runtime issues.

## Installation

```bash
npm install use-remote-data
```

```bash
yarn add use-remote-data
```

## Basic Usage

The primary entry point is the **`useRemoteData`** hook.
It takes one parameter—a function that produces a `Promise`—and returns a `RemoteDataStore<T>`.
Because we need the ability to retry, you must pass a function rather than a direct `Promise`.

- According to [React Hooks rules](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html), the hook must be used inside a component.
- The object returned by `useRemoteData` is our `RemoteDataStore<T>`.

## Rendering with `WithRemoteData`

In the example above, you can see that the store is passed to a `WithRemoteData` component
in order to fetch the data and render it.

One curious possibly unfamiliar thing is that it uses a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html)
that receives your successfully loaded data (along with an `isInvalidated` boolean).

Out of the box, `WithRemoteData` handles loading and error states but is visually minimal,
including `JSON.stringify`ing error objects.

**Recommended usage** is therefore to copy/paste the `WithRemoteData` component into your codebase,
and provide your own rendering for everything.
