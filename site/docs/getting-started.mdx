# Getting Started

`use-remote-data` is a small library that provides a principled, type-safe way to manage asynchronous state in your React applications.

It revolves around a [**state machine**](state-machine) represented by the `RemoteData` type,
and a corresponding `RemoteDataStore` that orchestrates fetching, caching, invalidation, and retries—all while staying strongly typed.

## Installation

```bash
npm install use-remote-data
```

```bash
yarn add use-remote-data
```

---

## Basic Usage

The primary entry point is the **`useRemoteData`** hook.
It takes one parameter—a function that produces a `Promise`—and returns a `RemoteDataStore<T>`.
Because we need the ability to retry, you must pass a function rather than a direct `Promise`.

- According to [React Hooks rules](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html), the hook must be used inside a component.
- The object returned by `useRemoteData` is our `RemoteDataStore<T>`.

## Rendering with `WithRemoteData`

In the example above, you can see that the store is passed to a `WithRemoteData` component
in order to fetch the data and render it.

One curious possibly unfamiliar thing is that it uses a [render prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html)
that receives your successfully loaded data (along with an `isInvalidated` boolean).

Out of the box, `WithRemoteData` handles loading and error states but is visually minimal,
including `JSON.stringify`ing error messages.

**Recommended usage** is therefore to copy/paste the `WithRemoteData` component into your codebase,
and provide your own rendering for everything.
