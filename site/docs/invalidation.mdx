# Invalidation / Refresh data

Sometimes data becomes out-of-date.

`use-remote-data` supports “invalidation” through an optional `invalidation: InvalidationStrategy` parameter to the hook.

An **`InvalidationStrategy`** is a function that decides whether to keep data or mark it stale.

## By time

Here is an example where data is considered stale after 2 seconds.

In the `<WithRemoteData>` render prop,
you can check the second argument (`isInvalidated`)
to decide whether to let the user see old data or a loading indicator.

### Only Sometimes?

You can enable or disable invalidation dynamically by swapping the `invalidation` strategy in or out. For instance:

<Snippet snippet="invalidation_sometimes" />

## Poll until valid data

Something that comes up sometimes is APIs which require you to poll.
`use-remote-data` supports this through `InvalidationStrategy.pollUntil`

## Invalidate on Dependency Change

`useRemoteData` and `useRemoteDatas` let you provide a `dependencies` array (similar to React’s `useEffect`):

```tsx
useRemoteData(() => fetchData(), {
    dependencies: [props.userId, otherValue],
});
```

When the dependency array changes, the store invalidates automatically, and `triggerUpdate()` will re-fetch if needed.
(Currently, it compares dependencies by `JSON.stringify`.)
