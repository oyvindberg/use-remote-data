# Lazy Loading

An interesting aspect of `useRemoteData` is no data is fetched when you call `useRemoteData`.

Only when the data is rendered with `WithRemoteData` is the request initiated.
This is handy, because then you can initialize many `RemoteDataStore`s in a component high up in the hierarchy, and pass them down to children.
