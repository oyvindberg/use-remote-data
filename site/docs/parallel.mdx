# Parallel vs. Sequential Fetching

When your app renders data from multiple `RemoteDataStore` instances, they will initiate their requests in parallel if the data is missing or old.

This parallel behavior ensures quicker overall loading times when you need multiple pieces of data at once.

If you need to fetch data in a specific order, you can achieve this by nesting `WithData` inside `WithData` in your JSX,
meaning that the inner won't be rendered/requested until the outer has finished.
