# Sharing Data with Child Components

A common pattern is to fetch data high in your component tree and share it among multiple routes or components,
leveraging built-in caching so that each route doesn’t refetch unnecessarily.

Since `RemoteDataStore` is both _lazy_ and _caching_, you can pass the same store to multiple children.
Data is fetched only once, and the results remain in memory as long as a store is in use.

### Should I Pass `RemoteDataStore<T>` or Just `T`?

There’s a subtle difference:

> _Does the child component need to render anything while data is still loading?_

- If yes, consider passing a `RemoteDataStore<T>` so the child can handle loading/failure states.
- Otherwise, if the parent already handles loading and passes down final data, just pass `T`.
