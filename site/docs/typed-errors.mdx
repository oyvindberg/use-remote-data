# Typed errors

An interesting feature of `use-remote-data` is its ability to handle **typed errors**,
letting you differentiate domain-level failures (like `PersonNotFound` or `PersonDeleted`)
from unexpected ones (network failed).

By default, all error situations are unexpected â€” caused by a failed promise or a thrown exception.

However, if consume an API, say a GraphQL schema that returns various error objects,
you can choose to use `useRemoteDataEither` (or `useRemoteDatasEither` for [dynamic data](dynamic-data))
instead to capture these domain-level errors.

This returns a `RemoteDataStore<T, E>`, where `E` represents your custom error type.

## Why Use Typed Errors?

- **Clarity:** Preserve the exact structure of your GraphQL or REST error responses instead of flattening everything into a generic `Error`.
- **Precise rendering:** Make decisions in your React components about each error variant, offering more relevant messages or fallback flows.

## Render typed errors
You'll need to prove a custom error component to `WithRemoteData`.
Typically, you can also create a specialized wrapper component around `WithRemoteData` that uses your custom error-handling component.

By doing so, your UI can leverage the fully typed nature of these errors,
presenting tailored messages or fallback flows for each distinct error variant.

Meanwhile, any genuinely unexpected runtime error still appears as `WeakError`.

This is a reasonably long example with a fake GraphQL schema that can return a `PersonNotFoundError` or `PersonDeletedError`.
