# Updates (Write Operations)

Your application might need to send data back to the server.
While `use-remote-data` focuses on read operations,
you can still integrate writes by calling out to the server in your components.
After a successful write,
call `invalidate()` or `triggerUpdate()` to refresh any store that depends on the changed data.
